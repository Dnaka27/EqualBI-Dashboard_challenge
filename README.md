# EqualBI Challenge

## 📝 Overview

This is a proposed solution for an internship challenge focused on data visualization. I created an interactive dashboard to facilitate data interpretation and simple queries. The application was built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and serves as a report containing managerial information, such as products, customers, and branches.
